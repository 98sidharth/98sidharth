-->Variables and data types
-->Control structures (if/else statements, loops)
-->Functions
-->Lists, tuples, and dictionaries
-->Object-oriented programming (classes and objects)

You can then navigate to the different directories to view and run the scripts. Each script contains comments explaining what it does and how it works.

This repository is intended for beginners who are just starting to learn Python, so the scripts are kept simple and straightforward. If you have any questions or suggestions for improvement, please feel free to submit an issue or pull request.

Happy coding!
